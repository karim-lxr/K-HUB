><P
>The X Window System is the standard GUI for all UNIX platforms, and this
includes Linux.  Unlike Windows and MacOS, in Linux and Unix the GUI is 
separate from the main operating system kernel.  This adds stability to the 
system: if the GUI crashes, it doesn't take out the entire system.</P
><P
>One problem with X is that it has traditionally been very hard to configure
for a system.  However, Slackware 7 introduced a configure-less X setup
that uses the framebuffer driver.  This means that you don't have to go
through the procedures described in <A
HREF="c1364.html#XF86CONFIG"
>the section called <I
>xf86config</I
></A
> and 
<A
HREF="x1559.html"
>the section called <I
>XF86Setup</I
></A
>.  The framebuffer will also work on any 
VESA 2.0-compliant video cards.  This means that just about any modern video 
card will work under X.  However, the framebuffer is noticeably slower than 
using an X configuration tailored to your system.</P
><P
>If you choose to use the framebuffer server, you should install the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>xxfb.tgz</TT
> package from the X software series.  You should 
also choose one of the console resolutions during the configuration section 
of the installer.  The recommended option for X is probably best for most 
people.</P
><P
>If you choose to configure X for your system, you'll need to follow the
instructions in <A
HREF="c1364.html#XF86CONFIG"
>the section called <I
>xf86config</I
></A
> or <A
HREF="x1559.html"
>the section called <I
>XF86Setup</I
></A
>.  
The first section describes using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xf86config</B
>(1), a 
commandline-based program for configuring X.  The second section describes 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>XF86Setup</B
>(1), a graphical version of the configuration 
program.</P

><H1
CLASS="SECT1"
><A
NAME="XF86CONFIG"
>xf86config</A
></H1
><P
><B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xf86config</B
> is one of two programs that can be used to 
configure X on your system.  The basic idea is simple: you will be presented 
with a series of questions and multiple choice answers.  Choose the answer 
that best fits your system.  After proceeding through the entire program, the 
<TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>/etc/XF86Config</TT
>(5) file will be written and you will be 
ready to use X.  If you mess up at some point, you'll have to kill the program 
using <TT
CLASS="USERINPUT"
><B
>control-c</B
></TT
> and start over from the beginning.</P
><P
>It helps to know as much as possible about your monitor and video card
before using <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>xf86config</B
>.  You can get information about your 
video card using the <B

will not attempt to do something outside of their specifications.  Older
monitors might be damaged, though.  When in doubt, pick a conservative
range.</P

>Having your monitor's documentation would be a good reference for these next
few questions.  For most newer monitors, you can probably pick 31.5-48.5 or 
31.5-57.0.  Those of you will high-end monitors can choose one of the larger 
ranges.  Or, you can enter your own horizontal sync range if you don't see one

this question.  When in doubt, go for a narrow range.  A safe choice would
probably be 50-90 or 50-100.  If you don't see one that fits your monitor, you 
can choose to enter your own range.</P

>The next large section of configuring X deals with your video card.  Your
card's documentation and the information from <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SuperProbe</B
>
will both prove handy right now.  You will want to look through the card
database to pick out your card, so answer &#8220;y&#8221; to the question.
Just hitting enter will take you past the card database and into the next
section.</P
><P
>There are over 800 cards in the database.  The left column contains a number
for each card and the card's name.  The right column contains the chipset
for that card.  Keep hitting enter until you find your video card in the list.
When you've found your card, enter the number and hit enter.  If you don't 
know what kind of video card you have, there are a few options.  First, you 
could look at the &#8220;Chipset&#8221; line from 
<B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>SuperProbe</B
> and look for a card matching that chipset in the 
database.  Or, you could use a generic SVGA card type.  Many cards that do not 
have their own server are supported by the SVGA server, so this could be a safe 
choice.</P
><P
>After picking a card, it will give you some more information.  Following the
ATI Rage Pro example from above, it would give this kind of information:</P

package.  The XF86_Mach64 server is in the <TT

selected your video card correctly, you can safely hit Enter.  That will tell 
X to use the server that the card specified.  Otherwise, you can pick to use 
the Mono server, VGA16 server, SVGA server, or an accelerated server.  The best
choice is to use the server that the card specified.</P

chip is present on your video card.  Go through the list until you've found the 
correct chip, then enter the corresponding number.  If you're not using the S3,

>Now it's time to select the video modes that your X server will use.  You
will see four different color depths - 8bpp, 16bpp, 24bpp, and 32bpp.  Each
will have a listing of the various video modes that can be run at that
color depth.  When you start up X, it will enter a default color depth and
run at the first resolution listed for that color depth.  If you'd like
X to start up in a different resolution by default, now is the time to do
that.</P

digits that correspond to the order of the resolutions.  If you simply wanted 
to reverse the order of the resolutions, you could answer like so:</P

>After selecting your modes at that color depth, you will be asked if you'd
like a virtual screen that is bigger than the physical screen.  A virtual
screen is a screen that is bigger than the actual monitor.  When you move
the mouse around on the virtual screen, it will scroll a bit before coming
to the edge.  This allows you to fit more windows onto your monitor.  However,
because you will not be able to see everything at once, the virtual screen
can be a bit annoying.  It is still an interesting thing to play with,
so you might want to try it out.</P

video modes for the 24bpp color depth, it would look like this:</P
