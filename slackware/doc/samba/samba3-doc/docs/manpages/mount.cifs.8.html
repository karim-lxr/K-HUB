It
is usually invoked indirectly by
the <a href="mount.8.html"><span class="citerefentry"><span class="refentrytitle">mount</span>(8)</span></a> command when using the 
"-t cifs" option. This command only works in Linux, and the kernel must
support the cifs filesystem. The CIFS protocol is the successor to the 
SMB protocol and is supported by most Windows servers and many other
commercial servers and Network Attached Storage appliances as well as 
by the popular Open Source server Samba.
	</p><p>
	The mount.cifs utility attaches the UNC name (exported network resource) to
	the local directory <span class="emphasis"><em>mount-point</em></span>. It is possible to set the mode for mount.cifs to 
setuid root to allow non-root users to mount shares to directories for which they
have write permission.
	</p><p>
		Options to <span class="emphasis"><em>mount.cifs</em></span> are specified as a comma-separated
list of key=value pairs. It is possible to send options other
than those listed here, assuming that the cifs filesystem kernel module (cifs.ko) supports them.   
Unrecognized cifs mount options passed to the cifs vfs kernel code will be logged to the
kernel log.

	</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>mount.cifs</em></span> causes the cifs vfs to launch a thread named cifsd. After mounting it keeps running until
		the mounted resource is unmounted (usually via the umount utility).

	The cifs vfs accepts the parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>user=</tt></i>, or for users familiar with smbfs it accepts the longer form of the parameter <i class="parameter"><tt>username=</tt></i>.  Similarly the longer smbfs style parameter names may be accepted as synonyms for the shorter cifs parameters <i class="parameter"><tt>pass=</tt></i>,<i class="parameter"><tt>dom=</tt></i> and <i class="parameter"><tt>cred=</tt></i>.

for a password, unless the guest option is specified.
</p><p>Note that a password which contains the delimiter

This is preferred over having passwords in plaintext in a

                access by the user doing the mount.
                Note that this does not affect the normal ACL check on the

                This precludes mmaping files on this mount. In some cases
                with fast networks and little or no caching benefits on the
                client (e.g. when the application is doing large sequential
                reads bigger than page size without rereading the same data)
                this can provide better performance than the default
                behavior which caches reads (readahead) and writes
                (writebehind) through the local Linux client pagecache
                if oplock (caching token) is granted and held. Note that
                direct allows write operations larger than page size
                to be sent to the server. On some kernels this requires the cifs.ko module
		to be built with the CIFS_EXPERIMENTAL configure option.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">mapchars</span></dt><dd><p>Translate six of the seven reserved characters (not backslash, but including the colon, question mark, pipe, asterik, greater than and less than characters)
                to the remap range (above 0xF000), which also
                allows the CIFS client to recognize files created with
                such characters by Windows's POSIX emulation. This can
                also be useful when mounting to most versions of Samba
                (which also forbids creating and opening files
                whose names contain any of these seven characters).
                This has no effect if the server does not support
                Unicode on the wire.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">nomapchars</span></dt><dd><p>Do not translate any of these seven characters (default)</p></dd><dt><span class="term">intr</span></dt><dd><p>currently unimplemented</p></dd><dt><span class="term">nointr</span></dt><dd><p>(default) currently unimplemented </p></dd><dt><span class="term">hard</span></dt><dd><p>The  program  accessing  a file on the cifs mounted file system will hang when the

		The CIFS client can get and set POSIX ACLs (getfacl, setfacl) to Samba servers
		version 3.10 and later.  Setting POSIX ACLs requires enabling both XATTR and
		then POSIX support in the CIFS configuration options when building the cifs
		module.  POSIX ACL support can be disabled on a per mount basic by specifying
		"noacl" on mount.</p></dd><dt><span class="term">serverino</span></dt><dd><p>Use inode numbers (unique persistent file identifiers)
		returned by the server instead of automatically generating
                temporary inode numbers on the client.  Although server inode numbers
                make it easier to spot hardlinked files (as they will have
                the same inode numbers) and inode numbers may be persistent (which is
		userful for some sofware),
                the server does not guarantee that the inode numbers
                are unique if multiple server side mounts are exported under a
                single share (since inode numbers on the servers might not
                be unique if multiple filesystems are mounted under the same
                shared higher level directory).  Note that not all 
                servers support returning server inode numbers, although
		those that support the CIFS Unix Extensions, and Windows 2000 and
		later servers typically do support this (although not necessarily
		on every local server filesystem). Parameter has no effect if
                the server lacks support for returning inode numbers or equivalent.

The primary mechanism for making configuration changes and for reading 
debug information for the cifs vfs is via the Linux /proc filesystem.
In the directory <tt class="filename">/proc/fs/cifs</tt> are various 
configuration files and pseudo files which can display debug information.  
For more information see the kernel file <tt class="filename">fs/cifs/README</tt>.
</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id2448638"></a><h2>BUGS</h2><p>Mounting using the CIFS URL specification is currently not supported.

Note that the typical response to a bug report is a suggestion
to try the latest version first. So please try doing that first,
and always include which versions you use of relevant software
when reporting bugs (minimum: mount.cifs (try mount.cifs -V), kernel (see /proc/version) and
