swaret - ChangeLog
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE DATE: Tuesday, 24th February, 2004 - 7:00 AM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.6.2
-------------------
#1 - Fixed: GPG check (thanks Peter Chou!)
#2 - Fixed: swaret Slackware Package - Install Script.  Now removes old .cache files
#3 - Fixed: swaret --set ROOT or REPOS_ROOT now works (adds, does not change)
#4 - Fixed: FILELIST.TXT changed, so internal code has been changed to reflect this 
- Added: swaret.lang.ARABIC 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RELEASE DATE: Tuesday, 17th February, 2004 - 7:00 AM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.6.1
-------------------
- Fixed: --get -s
- Fixed: --dep KEYWORD
- Fixed: User input with Manual mode must be either one of the choices, or <enter> for
         default.
- Fixed: --extra action.
- Fixed: swaret Slackware Package - Install Script.  Moving of swaret.lang.LANGUAGE file
         removed.
- Updated: --update (Tweaks)
- Updated: Dependency Support
- Updated: --update ; swaret will first Fetch the CHECKSUMS.md5 List File, and will
           check out wether the other cached List Files are up-to-date are not.
           This way, swaret will work MUCH faster ;-)
- Updated: Dependency Support ; swaret will Fetch from now on also the Libraries List
           on Repositories created with 'swaret-tools'. By this way, we do not need
           to Download the MANIFEST.bz2 File (Libraries Package) to attach Libraries
           to Package Names. And if swaret fails with Fetching the Libraries List on
           any Repository, it will still try to Fetch the Libraries Package.
- Updated: (/etc/swaret.conf.new) swaret.conf 
- Updated: (/usr/doc/swaret-1.6.1/HELP) HELP
- Updated: (/usr/doc/swaret-1.6.1/HOW-TO-USE-SWARET/htus.LANGUAGE) htus.ENGLISH

- Updated: (/usr/man/man5/swaret.conf.5.gz) swaret.conf(5)
- Updated: (/usr/doc/swaret-1.6.1/TODO) TODO
- Updated: All Language Files found in: /usr/share/swaret-1.6.1
- Added: --extra -u get ; With this new option for the --extra action you can
         now get Packages matching Package Names found in any file created with: 
         --extra -u save
- Added: Several Language Files:
         htus.POLISH
         swaret.lang.BULGARIAN
         swaret.lang.ESPANOL_MX
	 swaret.lang.LITHUANIAN
         swaret.lang.MALAY
         swaret.lang.POLISH
	 swaret.lang.PORTUGUES_BR
         swaret.lang.SLOVAK
- Added: --compile ; This option is marked *Experimental*.  The download engine for 
         source code and buildscripts will be rewritten in the next major release.

- Rewritten: swaret(8)
- Bug Fixes - I think we got all of them. ;-)

Version 1.4.0
-------------
#3 - Fixed: Patches Support thanks to street-tv.
#2 - Fixed: Upgrade Engine (Comparisations between Official and Unofficial Packages)
            Please, remember that version checking is not working 100%, and neither
            in other package tools, because people use all kind of weird versions,
            and it's difficult to figure out wether its greater or lesser.
            If swaret says: 'up-to-date' and you are sure there is a new version
            out there for a Package, just --get the Package and upgradepkg manually.
            I don't want people to have Downgrade problems, so this is the best way.
#2 - Fixed: Dependency Support, skipping Packages
- Updated: /etc/swaret.conf.new - PLEASE, USE THIS ONE! ;-)
- Updated: swaret.conf(5) & swaret(8) Manuals
- Updated: HELP
- Updated: TODO
- Updated: README
- Updated: FAQ
- Updated: HOW-TO-USE-SWARET
- Updated: LinuxPackages DOT NET (http://www.linuxpackages.net)
           is now ready with Packages for Slackware 8.1 and Higher
           to be used with swaret using Repository Support and
           also Dependency Support.
- Updated: Upgrade Engine. Slackware Package Version Checker.
- Updated: --faq action. Provide a Keyword to Search for Q&A.
- Updated: --htus action. Provide a Keyword to Search for Examples.
- Updated: Advanced REGEXP Support for all actions matching a Keyword!
- Updated: Dependency Support. If the Libraries Package is not up-to-date,
           swaret will download it again, else if its up-to-date, swaret
           swaret use the locally cache Libraries Package.
           The Repository you are using must have a correct FILELIST.TXT
           List File for realizing.
- Added: Internationalization (i18n) Support. 
         Language Files can be copied from /usr/share/swaret-VERSION
         to /etc/swaret.lang, and start using swaret.
         If your Language (File) is not available, you can always take
         a look on the swaret Site at http://www.swaret.org/?menu=i18n
- Added: Language Files: - swaret.lang.ENGLISH (default)
                         - swaret.lang.NEDERLANDS
                         - swaret.lang.FRANCAIS
                         - swaret.lang.DEUTSCH
                         - swaret.lang.NORSK
         Copy /usr/share/swaret-1.4.0/swaret.lang.LANGUAGE to /etc/swaret.lang,
         and start using swaret.
- Added: Repository Support, Check latest Questions in F.A.Q. (--faq) 
         how to use a Remote Repository or a Local Repository.
         swaret now also works with LinuxPackages DOT NET,
         with Dependency Support!
- Added: GPG Support for Repository Packages. Consult F.A.Q. (--faq gpg)
- Added: Dependency Support for Repository Support.
- Added: --extra action. Execute the Command: 'swaret --extra', and watch
         out what swaret can do for you. Save Upgrade List to a File, and
         Mail the Upgrade List. You can also request 'Extra Commands'
         which can be implemented in future swaret Versions.
         Check out the swaret Forum, http://www.swaret.org
- Added: -u and -au option to the --get action.
         Get available Packages to Upgrade
- Added: --check action. Check if swaret is up-to-date.
         This does not work with prerelease versions!
- Added: USEPKGDESC Variable to swaret.conf.new
         If set to 1, swaret will also match Packages whose Description
         is matching the Keyword you specify after --ACTION.
         NOTE: swaret will parse all the Package Descriptions for this,
               and might slow down swaret when using an older System.
- Removed: DESCRIPTIONS Variable (Descriptions will be fetched when using --update).
           REVERSEP Variable (swaret will use the ROOT, REPOS_ROOT and DEP_ROOT
                              Variables by the order found in /etc/swaret.conf).
           DEP_UPGRADE, DEP_INSTALL and DEP_REINSTALL Variables. swaret will
           find out wether to Install a new Package, to Re-Install an installed
           Packages or to Upgrade a Package.
- Removed: --pgp is now --gpg, and we talk now about GPG and not PGP anymore ;-)
- Removed: --clear [-l] (Clear Log File) is now --log -c
- Removed: exclude -gen (Generate Exclude Files), swaret will figure out wether
           you've made changes to the EXCLUDE Variable(s) in /etc/swaret.conf
           and start the Exclude function to do it ;-)
- Rewritten: Dependency Support.
- Code Review & Tweaks & Cleanup
- Bug Fixes - nothing is bugfree ;-)

Version: 1.3.4
--------------
#7 - Updated: FAQ (--faq), Questions 8 & 9.
#7 - Fixed: MAJOR Bug in the PGP Support.
            (Bug Report by: heguita <higuita@gmx.net>)
#7 - Fixed: Removed Version Check (which doesnt work properly) from Upgrade Engine,
            and added a better solution. Downgrade situations can happen when the
            Slackware distro needs a rollback for some Package, or if you have
            created your own package (you need to Exclude it in /etc/swaret.conf,
            by adding -*YOURNAME$ in one of the Exclude Vars), 
            or you are not using up-to-date Slackware Linux Mirrors.
#7 - Fixed: Patches Support (Everywhere)
#7 - Fixed: All kind of little issues
#6 - Fixed: Package
#5 - Fixed: RSYNC Bug in update_lists()
#5 - Updated: Listing Packages/Patches/Sources works much faster now.
              (--list and --search actions)
#5 - Updated: Every time you use any actions, swaret will clean up the Packages Cache
              Directory, so you can get a better view to the Packages found in there,
              instead of viewing all the garbage swaret has collected to use actions.
#5 - Updated: Upgrade Engine Supports now Version Checking (it doesnt work 100%, but
              should work on allmost all Packages). Packages with weird Versions will
              never get Upgraded, unless you check the ChangeLog yourself.
              I don't want people to complain about Downgrade 'issues', so I made
              a Version Check in swaret to satisfy all people using swaret.
              So remember, if you are sure there are new Versions of some Packages
              out there, viewed with --changelog, you can --remove the previous
              Version and --install the new Version of these Packages.
              Version Check should be a better way, Downgrading stuff *NOT*.
              As I said before, nobody can make a perfect Version Checker 
              for Slackware Packages, because the Versions know a great Variation.
#5 - Note 1:  I've done a fast review of the full swaret code, and looks good now.
#5 - Note 2:  This is the last buildfix for swaret 134, it has been tested, and should
              be stable enough. I'll release in the coming days the Repository Support
              test Versions of swaret. With Repository Support, you can Download and
              Install Packages from www.linuxpackages.net, and other.
- Changes: swaret has been completely rewritten, reviewed and debugged.
           swaret 1.3.4 contains the 'fundamental' code for the Repository Support.
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           The upcoming (very soon) swaret test versions with Repository Support,
           will be able to Download Packages from www.slackwarepackages.net and other.
           (Packages like: mplayer, firebird, and more).
           It will also be possible to create your own Slackware Tree with Packages,
           and tell swaret to use it. There will be only one --install action for all.
           Please, visit www.swaret.org regularly, to check out for a test version.
           ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
           swaret has now about +/- 6500 lines instead of the previous 10.000 lines.
           It works much faster in comparisation with previous swaret Versions.
- Fixed: Bug in LibMaker.
- Fixed: Bug in libraries_create() Function.
- Fixed: Bugs in update_*lists*() Functions.
- Fixed: Bug in Resume Support
- Fixed: Bug in Sources Procedure
- Updated: Install Procedures (check for previous pkg version)
- Updated: swaret.conf.new (/usr/doc/swaret-1.3.4/swaret.conf.new)
           swaret.conf.new MUST be used for this Version, 
           because I removed lots of Variables which are not usable anymore.
           Check it out ;-)
- Updated: FAQ (/usr/doc/swaret-1.3.4/FAQ)
- Updated: HOW-TO-USE-SWARET (/usr/doc/swaret-1.3.4/HOW-TO-USE-SWARET)
- Updated: README (/usr/doc/swaret-1.3.4/README)
- Updated: --download is now --get.
- Updated: Exclude Method.
- Updated: Upgrade Engine, which parses also the ChangeLog for the Latest Packages.
           The parsing is needed for some Security Reasons.
           If you had previously problems with 'up-to-date' Packages, and you were
           sure there was a new Version of a Package out there, 
           then you got lucky from now on, because the Updated Upgrade Engine
           should solve these Problems ;-)
- Updated: All the *-all actions have been removed, 
           it works now with one simple command.
           Upgrade all Packages automatically will be: swaret --upgrade -a.
           Install (or try to Upgrade) Patches: swaret --install -ap.
           If you don't supply a Keyword to some action, 
           it will be applied on all Packages, Patches or Sources.
- Added: REGEXP Support for all actions.
         If you want to Search for KDE Packages, matching the NL Language,
         use: swaret --search kde.*nl.*, simple as that!
         A simple Pattern like: swaret --search kde, is also enough.
         Search on Google how to use REGEXP.
- Bug Fixes - nothing is bugfree ;-)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thursday, 16th October, 2003 - 1:00 AM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.3
--------------
- Updated: swaret.conf.new! Please use this new Config File, it contains
           exclude keywords like '-*dl' for Dropline Gnome Packages,
           kernel, lilo and more.
- Updated: FAQ
- Updated: HOW-TO-USE-SWARET
- Added: DSEARCHM Variable in /etc/swaret.conf,
         This Variable is only used in the Dependency Check when DSEARCHLIB set to 1
         which will allow swaret to Search for missing Libraries
         on your Slackware System, Search can be done either by find or slocate.
         That's why you can set DSEARCHM to 0 or 1. Check swaret.conf for more info.
         Set to 1, if you want swaret to use the 'slocate' program
         to Search for missing Libraries. If set to 0, swaret will
         use the 'find' program to locate missing Libraries.
- Added: -v option to the purge action
         Purge all Packages/Patches/Extra Packages Versions
         in Cache Directory (default: /var/swaret)
         but keep the most recent Version
- Added: Exclude and Keep, implemented in Exclude Method,
         For Example:
         EXCLUDE=kernel[kernel-sources,kernel-headers] xfree[docs] 
         EXCLUDE=kde-i18n[nl,en] koffice-i18n[nl,en]
         Exclude Kernel, and keep Kernel Sources and Kernel Headers
         Exclude XFree, and keep XFree docs
         Exclude kde-i18n and keep nl/en versions
         Exclude koffice-i18n and keep nl/en versions 
- Added: set action to set Variables in /etc/swaret.conf using commandline.
         For example: swaret --set DEPENDENCY=0
         If you use the command swaret --set, its also possible 
         to get the Full List of Variables set in /etc/swaret.conf!
- Added: li-all (List All) and --se-all (Search All) actions  
         for Packages/Patches/Extra Packages/Sources
         applicable on the following options: - show available
                                              - show none installed 
			                      - show ready for upgrade
- Added: sh-all (Show All Descriptions) action for Packages/Patches/Extra Packages
- Added: Multiple Keywords using a command (,)
         For example: swaret --install gnome,kde,xfree86 -a
- Added: Slackware Map(s) as Keyword,
         For example: - swaret --upgrade a/,ap/,xap/
                      - swaret --install gnome/ 
                      - swaret --do-all n/ -a
- Added: exclude action (-on|-off|-gen)
         Choose wether you want to use EXCLUDE method or not.
         Else you need to comment the EXCLUDE Variables manually.
         You need also regenerate (-gen) the Exclude List everytime
         you've made changes to the EXCLUDE Variables in swaret.conf.
         Check FAQ and HOW-TO-USE-SWARET about EXCLUDE.
- Added: REVERSEP Variable in swaret.conf.
         First use http/ftp/rsync Protocols and then file Protocol,
         and same for the reverse direction ;-)
         Lets say you got a Slackware CD-ROM mounted on /mnt/cdrom 
         (also added to swaret.conf as: ROOT=file:/mnt/cdrom)
         and you have also http/ftp/rsync Mirrors set,
         you have to change REVERSEP to 1 in swaret.conf so swaret
         will first take a look on your CD-ROM and then on the http/ftp/rsync
         Slackware Linux Mirrors. If you want first use http/ftp/rsync and 
         then file, set REVERSEP to 0 (default).
- Changed: DINTERFACE has been renamed to PROGRESS in /etc/swaret.conf
           The progress bar is also a little bit longer then before.
- Rewritten: Upgrade engine, WORKS FASTER >3< TIMES FASTER! =)
- Rewritten: Exclude Method, it works now on all features, 
             also --list and --search ;-)
- Removed: ONLY and IMPORTANT feature (*broken*)
- Bug Fixes - nothing is bugfree ;-)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sunday, 12th October, 2003 - 9:00 PM
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.3.2
--------------
- Added: DINTERFACE can now be changed to 0, 1 and 2.
         If set to 0, swaret will use the '%' Download Interface
         (Example: --- [*****     ] 53%/100% [TOTAL: 1%/100%])
         If set to 1, swaret will use the 'size' Download Interface
         (Example: --- 1119 kB/1346 kB [TOTAL: 1119 kB/47748 kB] ~ 64 kB/s)
         If set to 2, swaret will use the 'wget/rsync' Download Interface
- Added: swaret can work on Slackware based Linux distributions.
- Added: file & http & ftp & rsync Protocol can now work together.
	 (Requested by: Mark <mark@givemehelp.co.uk>)
- Added: EXCLUDE works now on all actions,
         except list, search and show actions, useless
- Added: Case Insensitive everywhere.
- Added: DSEARCHLIB Variable in /etc/swaret.conf.
         Set to 1 if you want swaret to Search for missing Libraries
         which could be found on your System, but not tracked by ldconfig.
	 If swaret doesn't find the missing Libraries,
         you will need to Search them manually somewhere on the Internet. 
- Added: WGET_PROXY Variable in /etc/swaret.conf,
         you won't need to edit /etc/wgetrc anymore! ;-)
- Added: smirror action to create a Slackware Linux (whatever version) 
         Mirror using rsync.
- Added: libmaker action to create the Libraries List.
- Added: Libraries Creation by Dependency Check.
         swaret can create the Libraries List itself.
         Clear all DEP_ROOT Variable(s) and swaret will
         create it during Dependency Check using
         the defined ROOT Variable(s) in /etc/swaret.conf.
         If the DEP_ROOT Variable(s) are defined,
         swaret will Fetch or Copy the Libraries List.
         If you want to create the Libraries List yourself,
         use 'swaret --libmaker'. You can also clear all
