1.
Q: I got a question, what should I do?
A: The best thing is to forward you to the swaret Forum,
http://www.swaret.org and post your Question.
For more information, 
swaret --faq
swaret --manual
swaret --manual -c

2.
Q: When do I need to use the Command: 'swaret --update'?
A: You need to --update every time there are new
Packages and/or Patches and/or Sources out there.
If you don't --update the List Files regularly,
you won't be able to get the latest Files.
You can always use the Command, 'swaret --changelog',
which will Show the latest ChangeLog.
The ChangeLog is a Log File which gives you Information
about the latest Changes to Slackware Linux.
You can also check for changes at http://www.slackware.com/changelog/.

3.
--update <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can update the List Files.
If DESCRIPTIONS is set to 1 in /etc/swaret.conf,
it is also possible to fetch the Descriptions File
for Packages, Extra Packages, and Patches.

4.
--upgrade <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Upgrade Packages.
Each time there are new things out there,
remember to --update. So, if you want
to Upgrade the openssl Packages, use this:
swaret --upgrade openssl. Suppose you want 
to Upgrade Extra Package bittorrent, use:
swaret --upgrade bittorrent. You can
always use the --changelog action to check 
out if there are new things out there.
Let say you want to Upgrade all Packages
matching Keyword 'gnome', do it like this:
swaret --upgrade gnome. You want to Upgrade
all KDE Packages automatically, use this:
swaret --upgrade kde -a.
For Upgrading all Packages, you can use:
'swaret --upgrade'.

5.
--install <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Install Packages,
or Patches. Suppose you want 
to Install all Packages matching Keyword
'kde', use: swaret --install kde. And you
would like to Install 'xfree86' also, use:
swaret --install xfree86. You should also 
not forget to Install the latest Abiword
Word Processor, do it like this:
swaret --install abiword -a (automatically).
Ouch, you want also to install xcdroast to
burn CD's. xcdroast is an Extra Package,
so Install it with: swaret --install xcdroast.
There is a Patch available for OpenSSH,
Install it with: swaret --install openssh -p.
If there is a previous Version installed
of the OpenSSL Package, swaret will Upgrade it,
else swaret will Install the new OpenSSL Patch.
You can also use --upgrade ;-)

6.
--reinstall <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Re-Install installed 
Packages or Patches. Suppose you want to
Re-Install the whole Base System, use this:
swaret --reinstall a/ -a (automatically).
You want to Re-Install everything of gnome,
because your gnome Installation is f*cked up,
do it like this: swaret --reinstall gnome.
You want to Re-Install xcdroast, use this:
swaret --reinstall xcdroast.

7.
--remove <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Remove
installed Packages or Patches.
You want to Remove all KDE, gnome and xfree86
Packages automatically, use:
swaret --remove kde,gnome,xfree86 -a

8.
--get <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Get Packages, Patches
and/or Sources. Let say you want to Get
Packages matching Keyword glibc,
use: swaret --get glibc.
You also need to Get all Packages
matching Keyword bin-: swaret --get bin-.
You have mounted my CD-ROM Drive to /mnt/cdrom
and added file:/mnt/cdrom as ROOT in
/etc/swaret.conf, this means you can use Local Files.
To Get all available KDE Packages from CD-ROM,
use: swaret --get kde -a (automatically).
You want to compile OpenSSH and Apache+PHP yourself,
Get the Sources with: swaret --get openssh,apache,php -s
and use the 'SlackBuild' Scripts which are also
saved in the swaret Sources Cache Directory
(default: /var/swaret/sources).
Get all Packages to Upgrade automatically,
use: swaret --get -au ; Get all Packages
matching Keyword 'openssl' to Upgrade:
use: swaret --get openssl -au.

9.
--dep <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Track Missing
Libraries and Fix them. Let say your
GIMP Installation is f*cked up, and it's
missing some Libraries, you can use:
swaret --dep gnome. 
If there are NO DEP_ROOT Variable(s) defined
in /etc/swaret.conf, swaret will Fetch the
MANIFEST Package(s) from available Mirrors
and create the Libraries List itself.
Suppose you got a Local Copy of
Slackware Linux in the Directory
/mnt/slackware (maybe mounted with
iso9660, smbfs or nfs), you can comment
all the DEP_ROOT Variables in /etc/swaret.conf
and swaret will build the Libraries List
itself ;-) Remember to set NIC to 'lo' in
/etc/swaret.conf if you want to use
Local Files (Local Repository).
If you want to Dependency Check
Everything, use '--dep'.

10
--resume <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Resume broken
Packages, Patches, and Sources
found in the swaret Packages or Sources Cache Directory.
Resume all Packages: swaret --resume
Resume all Patches: swaret --resume -p
Resume all Sources: swaret --resume -s

11.
--list <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can List installed
and available Packages, Patches and/or Sources.
List all available Sources, use:
swaret --list -s. 
Suppose you want to List all Patches
which are not installed yet, use:
swaret --list -np. If you want to know which
Packages or Patches are installed 
on your System, use: swaret --list -i.
You want to see all available Packages out there?
Use: swaret --list.

12.
--search <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Search installed
or available Packages, Patches and/or Sources.
Let say you want to Search for all
available Sources matching Keyword KDE, use:
swaret --search kde -s. 
Suppose you want to Search for all Packages
matching Keyword 'open', so use:
swaret --search open. If you want to know which
Packages matching Keyword 'kernel' are installed 
on your System, use:
swaret --search kernel -i. If you need to know
which KDE Packages aren't installed yet,
use: swaret --search kde -n.
Search for available Packages evolution,
and mozilla: swaret --search evolution,mozilla

13.
--show <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can View the
Description for available or installed
Packages, Extra Packages and/or Patches.
You want to View the Description for the
installed KDE Packages, so use: 
swaret --show kde -i. You want to View the
Description for all available Gnome 
Packages, so use: swaret --show gnome.
Show Description for xcdroast and mplayer:
swaret --show xcdroast,mplayer.
Remember, you need to set up DESCRIPTIONS 
to 1 in /etc/swaret.conf and restart --update.

14.

Disable Search Libraries: swaret --set DSEARCHLIB=0
Change Network Interface to ppp0: swaret --set NIC=ppp0
Disable REPOS_ROOT URL's: swaret --set REPOS_ROOT=0
Disable ROOT URL: ftp://ftp.swaret.org:
swaret --set ROOT=ftp://ftp.swaret.org=0
For more information, use: 'swaret --set' and hit ENTER.

16.
--gpg <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Import
a Public GPG Key. I fetched the GPG Key

I will import it with this Command:
swaret --gpg -i GPG-KEY

17.
--log <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can View
the Log File, and if you use the -t

/var/log/swaret. To clear the
swaret Log File, use:
'swaret --log -c'

18.
--purge <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
With this action, you can Purge Files.
Lets say you want to Purge all Packages, 
use: swaret --purge. You want also to Purge
Sources, use: swaret --purge -s.
You would like to Purge the Cache Directory
with Files which are older then 4 Weeks,
use this Command: swaret --purge -w 4.
You would like to Purge the Sources Cache
Directory with Files which are older then
14 Days, so use: swaret --purge -ds 14.

19.
--check <> EXAMPLE:
===================================
Make Connection to the Internet (swaret.org)
using 'wget' and figure out if there is a new
Version available of swaret.

20.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Install all Packages with one Command.
===================================
Simply use the following Command:
swaret --install -a (Install All Packages automatically).
(Saved in swaret Packages Cache Directory, default: /var/swaret)

21.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Download all Patches with one Command.
===================================
swaret --get -ap
(Download All Patches automatically).
(Saved in swaret Packages Cache Directory, default: /var/swaret)

22.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Track all missing Libraries and Fix missing Libraries.
===================================
swaret --dep -a (Start Dependency Check automatically)
If swaret cannot Track the missing Libraries, 
you can always set DSEARCHLIB in /etc/swaret.conf to 1.
When starting the Dependency Check again, 
swaret will Search on your entire System
for the missing Libraries and add the 
necessary Directories to /etc/ld.so.conf.
(And swaret will restart ldconfig automatically of course)
swaret will use the 'find' program to Search
for missing Libraries, if you want to use the 'slocate'
Command, you can set DSEARCHM to 1 in /etc/swaret.conf! ;-)
You should also keep your 'slocate' Database up-to-date
with the 'updatedb' Command.

23.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Upgrade only XFree86 Fonts and Docs Packages, 
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> and Exclude other XFree86 Packages.
===================================
- You can do this with Exclude Method:
Edit /etc/swaret.conf and alter the EXCLUDE Variable(s) by 
adding the Keyword 'xfree86[docs,fonts]'.
Start the Upgrade Procedure and it will Upgrade Packages
matching xfree86-docs and xfree86-fonts,
and skip the other XFree86 Packages.
- You can do this with multiple Keywords:
swaret --upgrade xfree86-docs,xfree86-fonts

24.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Exclude kernel, lilo and other vital Packages
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> during Upgrade Procedure.
===================================
The Upgrade Procedure will run with EXCLUDE method.
Add the Keywords 'kernel' and 'lilo' 
to the EXCLUDE Variable(s) in /etc/swaret.conf.
When you start the Upgrade Procedure it will Upgrade
all installed Packages (matching a Keyword),
but not the Packages which have been excluded
(matching the EXCLUDE Variable(s) found in /etc/swaret.conf).

25.
VARIOUS EXAMPLE <> Install 'French' Language File
===================================
Copy /usr/share/swaret-VERSION/swaret.lang.FRANCAIS to
/etc/swaret.lang and start using swaret.
If it is not available, take a look at
http://www.swaret.org/?menu=i18n and
save the French Language File as /etc/swaret.lang,
and start using swaret.
