Swaret-tools-0.9

Swaret is a tool that allows a system administrator to update a Slackware
system.  Two features of swaret (the first existing, the second not yet 
implimented) add additional functionality, and these scripts help if you are a 
publisher of swaret content.

Swaret-tools is made up of two tools.  

libmaker
Creates a file, libraries-$VERSION which will either be uploaded (presently by 
scp) to a webserver, or moved into a directory.  If you are doing so for the
benifit of the public, please cron the job to run daily and send the URL to me
at mgmanry@linuxorbit.com so I can add your site to swaret.
Before running libmaker for the first time, edit the beginging of libmaker to
set various settings.  Then run "libmaker current" (or whatever version you
want).

repos
Creates a Slackware style directory, with FILELIST.txt, MANIFEST.bz2,
PACKAGES.TXT, CHECKSUMS.md5, and libraries-current.
All packages (along with the optional ascii armored gpg 
signatures of the packages) go into subdirectories of the directory of the URL 
(I'll call it DIRECTORY).  To see a good example of what the DIRECTORY should
look like, look at the extra/ directory at any Slackware mirror.  When the 
DIRECTORY is set up correctly, run "repos DIRECTORY" as a user with write
permissions to DIRECTORY.  Run "repos --help" to view options.
