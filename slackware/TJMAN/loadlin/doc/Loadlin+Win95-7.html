<LI>Slackware 3.2 contains a file named loadlin.tgz in the
\slackware\A5 directory, Slackware 3.3 and 3.4 have loadlin.tgz in
\slackware\A4. Unarchive the file and look in the \docs directory for a
file named manual.txt. I do not know about earlier versions of    
Slackware.

have this archive. The manual.txt is also available for download at:</LI>

</H2>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>At a Linux shell prompt, run the fdisk utility and press
"p". From there you should be able to tell. If you need additional help
using fdisk, please consult the man pages.</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss7.3">7.3 Where do I find the kernel image file and how do I copy it to my MS-DOS partition?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To find your linux kernel file type:

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        find / -name vmlinuz
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


at a Linux shell prompt. This will search all Linux partitions for the
vmlinuz file. If you have multiple vmlinuz files, then make sure you
use the correct one. If you are not sure, then the safest bet would be
to use the most recent one.
<P>To copy your linux kernel file to your DOS partition, you need to make
your DOS partition visible to Linux, then mount the partition if it is
not already. Generally, this should have been set up when you installed
Linux. All you need to do next is change to the directory the vmlinuz
file is in and copy it over to DOS using the cp command.
<P>However, if Linux was not set up to recognize your DOS partition, then
copy vmlinuz to a floppy. Take any DOS formatted floppy (with enough
disk space to hold your kernel image file) and insert it into your
floppy drive. Type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        mount /dev/fd0 /tmp

<P>at a Linux shell prompt. Then change to the directory your kernel image
file is in and type:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        cp vmlinuz /tmp
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This will copy vmlinuz to your floppy disk and it will be readable by
DOS. Shutdown Linux, boot to DOS, then copy vmlinuz to whichever
directory you choose. If you recompile your kernel, do not forget to
copy the new kernel image file to your DOS partition. This will
overwrite your old file, so it might be a good idea to rename the old
file first just in case the new one does not work properly.

<H2><A NAME="ss7.4">7.4 Does it matter if I install Linux or Windows 95 first?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Technically no. However, it would be <EM>much</EM> simpler to
install Win95 first. That way it is easier to setup Linux to recognize
your DOS partition(s) as you can usually do this during the Linux
installation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.5">7.5 What if I already dual boot between Windows 95 and Windows 3.x, and Iwant to boot to Linux using this method?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Frankly, if you want to do this I would recommend using LILO. However,
if you really do not want to use LILO, you will have to boot to Win 3.x
first, then issue the Loadlin command. (Make sure Windows 3.x is NOT   
running, but that you are in DOS 5.0 or 6.x).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss7.6">7.6 Is it possible to initiate Linux from the Windows 95 desktop?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Yes. First, create a batch file called linux.bat, for example.
Edit the file to contain a Loadlin command such as:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<HR>
<PRE>
        loadlin f:\vmlinuz root=/dev/hdc2 ro
</PRE>
<HR>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>


Now save the file in the \windows\desktop directory. Next, right click
on the Linux.bat icon, then left click on Properties. Now click on the
Program tab, then click on the Advanced button. Click on the box next
to MS-DOS mode and make sure the box next to "Warn before entering
MS-DOS mode is checked". Click OK, then click on OK again. Now when you
double click on the Linux icon, a warning box will appear before going
into MS-DOS mode. If you click on "Yes" then Windows enters MS-DOS mode
and executes the Linux.bat file.</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>NOTE:</B> You must be in MS-DOS mode in order to use Loadlin. Please
see the manual.txt file mentioned in
