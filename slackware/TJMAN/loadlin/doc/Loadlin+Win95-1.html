<P>This document describes how to easily use a combination of 
Windows 95's Boot Menu and Loadlin.exe to autoboot Linux using 
the F4 Function Key. This procedure should work with Windows 95 
versions 4.00.950 and 4.00.950a, and all versions of Linux that 
support Loadlin. If you prefer to use the LILO boot manager, 
please consult the
