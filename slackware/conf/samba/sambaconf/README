With this package my goal is to give to not expert users the hint
to use samba as a PDC (Primary Domain Controller) without making themselves
mad reading crappy stuff all over the internet.

It is very easy to use but... follow the instructions given in the file
called INSTALL.

And remember also the smbPDC.conf must be first edited and copied to the
right directory before running samba.


Here are the contents of the tar:


- INSTALL	-----> installation instructions (follow the steps inside here)
- THANKS	-----> who i want to thank for helping me

- smbinstdir	-----> this script makes the directory structure for the PDC
- smbadduser    -----> script to add samba PDC users
- smbdeluser    -----> script to delete samba PDC users
- smbcltrust    -----> script to add "Machine Trusted Accounts" (read INSTALL)
- grcontrol     -----> support script used by smbadduser

- nonpdc-smb.conf -----> simple samba conf file without pdc support
- smbPDC.conf   -----> samba conf file we are going to use


NOTE: This version is for samba 2.2.x (mainly samba 2.2.7a) not 3.x.
