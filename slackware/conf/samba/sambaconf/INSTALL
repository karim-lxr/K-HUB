INSTALL File:

This File explains to you how to install samba under a Linux Box.

I was testing this version of samba under Slackware Linux 8.0.

First you get the sources from a samba mirror:

$wget ftp://it.samba.org/pub/samba/samba-2.2.7a.tar.gz
$wget ftp://it.samba.org/pub/samba/samba-2.2.7a.tar.asc
$wget ftp://it.samba.org/pub/samba/samba-pubkey.asc

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT:

Compare the PGP signature for the source files before compile:

$ pgp --import samba-pubkey.asc
$ pgp --verify samba-2.2.7a.tar.gz

You must receive a message like:

Good Signature from Samba Distribution Verification Key.

If not choose another mirror and redownload the package.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS


1. Untarring and Compiling


Now we can configure and compile:

$ tar -xvzf samba-2.2.7a.tar.gz
$ cd samba-2.2.7a
$ cd source 

$ ./configure --with-smbmount --mandir=/usr/man --with-logfilebase=/var/log/samba
$ make -j 4 (double processor or P4 or P3) (if you do not have theese processors use make without -j 4)
$ su
# make install

Now you have samba installed in $PREFIX /usr/local/samba

Copy the file smbPDC.conf in /usr/local/samba/lib/ and rename it to
/usr/local/samba/lib/smb.conf



2. Configuring Samba as PDC


a) First make sure you run the script ./smbinstdir.

$ su
# ./smbinstdir


This script creates the directory structure for the samba PDC server.

It creates all the Domain Server directories as follows:


//NETBIOSANAMESAMBASERVER/	  -----> /home/samba/
//NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER/netlogon -----> /home/samba/netlogon/
//NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER/profiles -----> /home/samba/profiles/
//NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER/tmp      -----> /home/samba/tmp/


and gives the ownement of /home/samba/tmp to nobody:nogroup.


b) Create the script logon.bat on a pc running windows cause it must be
windows formatted not unix formatted.


Ex. logon.bat:


@echo off

echo "Configuring time and date.."
NET TIME \\NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER\ /SET /YES

echo "Setting up Network drives.."
NET USE Z: \\NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER\PUBLIC
NET USE P: \\NETBIOSNAMESAMBASERVER\HOMES



c) At this point you need to add users. To do so use the script "smbadduser".

$ su
# ./smbadduser testuser

A "testuser" user will be added on the server. Remember that the password to use
the first time you log on with a new user is: default.

You enter this password and at your first logon you will be prompted for a
new password.

note:	do you want a suggestion on how to make usernames for your users?
	I use this formula (developed by Fabio Landi),
	because i have to deal with a large amount of american users.

	username= 8 caracter long, first letter of their first name, first
	letter of their middle name, their first 6 letters of their last
	name.

	If the name does not have the middle name, repeat the first letter
	of the first name.
	
 Examples:

	Ex. 1 (American Kind of Name: first name, middle name, lastname)  
	Samuel Edward Johnson
	
	His username would be: sejohnso

	Ex. 2 (European Name)
	Lorenzo Allori

	His username would be: llallori

d) Remember to use the script "smbdeluser" to delete user:

$ su
# ./smbdeluser testuser

The user will be deleted both from the unix passwd file and from samba smbpasswd
file.





3. Configuring the clients


a) Win95/98/Me PCs.


	On your desktop right click on Network Neighborhood and choose
	properties.

	1. Choose "Client for Microsoft Networks" (if not in there install
	   it). Check the Box Called "Log on to Windows NT domain" and enter
	   the domain name (under the smb.conf file the entry is workgroup
	   so look to what you entered here and enter it in the text box whe
	   are talking about).

	2. reboot the machine



	3. Inside the network neighborhood properties choose the "Access 
	   Control" section on the top right of that window.
	   Check the box "User-level access control", and enter the domain
	   name.

b) Windows NT workstations, Win2k, WinXp.


	 
	1.  WinNT
	    
	    Use the script included called "smbcltrust" to create Machine
	    trust accounts. You have to use it for every NT machine you want
	    to join the domain.
	    
	    Then follow this steps on the NT Machine (you need to be
	    Administrator):
	    
	    
	    - Enter the Network properties (From the control panel)
	    
	    - Click on "Identification" tab anche click "Change"
	    
	    - Enter the textboxes with Computer Name and Domain name.
	      REMEMBER NOT TO CHECK THE BOX "Create a computer Account
	      in the Domain".
	      
	    - Click OK
	    
	    - You should be ginve a message like: Welcome to the Domain blablabla
	    
	    - Reboot and log in a a Domain user

	2.  Win 2000
	    
	    Do the same thing as win NT. (Wait for another version of this 
	    how-to because i did not tried yet working with this os)*
	    
	3.  Win XP
	
	    Do the same thing as win NT. (Wait for another version of this
	    how-to because i did not tried yet working with this os)*   
	    
	    

TROUBLESHOOTING:


- Remember that all the problems you will have copying stuff from a workstation
  to one of the server shares like permissions and stuff, you have to act in
  unix permissions, do not be mad using samba for filesystem permissions.

  Unix usernames and gruop. If you followed this installation you have a group
  called smbusers and to see your unix users you know how to mamage:

  # cat /etc/passwd.






HAVE FUN GUYS!

Lorenzo


NOTE: This version is only for samba 2.2.x (mainly 2.2.7a) not 3.x.
